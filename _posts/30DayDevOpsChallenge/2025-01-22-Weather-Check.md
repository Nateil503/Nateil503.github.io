**PROCESS**

I started by opening up VSCode, where I have the latest python script as well as AWS access.

After changing the directory and getting into the folder that has access to the 'requirements.txt' file, I was able to complete the install.

I made sure to create the environment, to which I learned that if there is not a specific way to create the environment... the echo command will automatically create the environment.

Next was the process to create the file for the installed requirements.

Finally I entered my AWS credentials to connect to the IAM console as well as access to the S3 buckets. Using the aws configure command prompt.

I was confused by running into this problem.
